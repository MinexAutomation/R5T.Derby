R5T.Derby - An opinionated application configuration startup types library.

Provides an application configuration startup type that:

* Adds the default appsettings.json file to it's configuration.
* Adds the direct configuration-based configuration-name provider service to its services.

This allows use of the configuration-name from the default appsettings.json file to add a configuration name-specific appsettings.json file to the configuration of the actual startup in two-stage application DI-container configuration.
